Eg. If you weighed {1,2,3} v/s {5,9,10} and they were equal you're problem would only reduce to {4,6,7,8}\nThe easiest way to solve this then is to compare 3 to 3, and make sure each side has elements from both AB such that whatever the measurement outcome in the worst case the problem reduces to 3 elements only.

Eg. If you weighed {1,2,3} v/s {5,9,10} and they were equal you're problem would only reduce to {4,6,7,8}\nThe easiest way to solve this then is to compare 3 to 3, and make sure each side has elements from both AB such that whatever the measurement outcome in the worst case the problem reduces to 3 elements only.

Now you cannot compare a group of 4 to 4, as in the best case it will only reduce the problem to 4 elements which is not good enough.\nIf you have to choose a set of 3 to compare, you cannot pick any 3 on the same side from the same set (A or B) because if you do this, a quick check will show you that in every choice there is a case where you can only get down to 4 elements. Eg. If you weighed {1,2,3} v/s {5,9,10} and they were equal you're problem would only reduce to {4,6,7,8}\nThe easiest way to solve this then is to compare 3 to 3, and make sure each side has elements from both AB such that whatever the measurement outcome in the worst case the problem reduces to 3 elements only.
